## **Problem 1:** Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]

Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

Output: 4

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]

Output: 1

 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.


## **Problem 2:** Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]

Output: true

Explanation:

The element 1 occurs at the indices 0 and 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: false

Explanation:

All elements are distinct.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]

Output: true


## **Problem 3**: Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.
